# Random Number Button

## Install

From within `examples/random-number-button` (where this README lives), you can
install the gems.

```
bundle install --path=.bundle
```

## Running

```
bundle exec foreman start
```


## Setup

You need to have a webhook endpoint running at `http://localhost:9000` for
this to successfully send a webhook event to.

I recommend
[random_number_texter](https://github.com/kyletolle/random_number_texter).

Having that as your webhook endpoint will mean the random generated by your
button click will be sent as a text message, like this example advertises!

## Pressing the button

Visit `http://localhost:9090` in your browser.

Press the button to generate a random number between 0 and 999. A webhook will
be send to the endpoint mentioned above. Assuming all's well, a text message
will be sent to that number with the random number!
